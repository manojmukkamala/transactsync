You are given an email and you have to perform a series of checks and extract the requested information.

check 1: Make sure the email is coming only from one of the financial institutions in the United States. You can confirm this by looking at the `from_address` which may likely look like: {from_address_filter}.

check 2: If yes, you have to determine if the email is only about a credit card purchase. You can confirm this by looking at the email subject which may likely look like: {subject_filter}.

check 3: If yes, you have to check the email body to verify if the email is only about a credit card purchase and not about payment and not about statement and not about transfer and not about deposit and not about withdrawal. 

If passed, then extract the following fields from this email:
```
- last 4 digits of account number or card number which is usually one of [{account_number_filter}]
- transaction date
- transaction amount
- merchant (if available)
```

and return JSON with the following keys and data types: 
```
- account_number string
- transaction_amount float
- transaction_date timestamp
- merchant string
- transaction_flag = true
```

check 4: If none of the above conditions satisfy, just return the following:
```
transaction_flag = false
```
